## Frontend Changes: Dark/Light Mode Toggle

### Files Modified

**frontend/index.html**
- Added a theme toggle button in the left sidebar, between the "New Chat" button and the course stats section.
- The button contains a theme icon (emoji) and a label that update dynamically.

**frontend/style.css**
- Added a `body.light-mode` ruleset with light theme CSS variable overrides (background, surface, text, border colors).
- Added `.theme-toggle-button` and `.theme-icon` styles for the new toggle button.
- Added `body.light-mode` specific overrides for assistant message bubbles, code blocks, and the welcome message to ensure proper contrast in light mode.

**frontend/script.js**
- Added `themeToggle`, `themeIcon`, and `themeLabel` to the DOM element references.
- Added `initTheme()` call in the `DOMContentLoaded` handler to restore the saved theme from localStorage on page load.
- Wired a click event listener on `themeToggle` to `toggleTheme()`.
- Added three new functions:
  - `initTheme()`: reads `localStorage.theme` and applies the saved theme on startup.
  - `toggleTheme()`: detects the current theme and switches to the opposite.
  - `applyTheme(theme)`: adds/removes the `light-mode` class on `<body>`, updates the button icon and label, and persists the choice to `localStorage`.
